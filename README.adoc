= Database Update

How to write the code of your app to allow doing A/B testing or/and continuous deployment.

== Assumptions

In order for the process to be relatively simple the following assumptions need to take place
while developing the app:

- use a database versioning tool (we'll be using https://flywaydb.org[Flyway])
- the database changes need to be backwards compatible
- if you want to do a backwards incompatible change you have to do it in a couple of deployments
- we don't want to do DB rollbacks. Not doing them simplifies the deployment process (some rollbacks are close to impossible like
rolling back a delete)
- we want to *ALWAYS* be able to rollback the application one version back (not more)

For readability we're versioning the apps with major increments.

== TL;DR

One of the approaches to do zero downtime deployment is to do the deploys in the following way for backwards incompatible changes
(example for changing column name from `last_name` to `surname`):

. deploy version `1.0.0` of the application with `v1` of db schema (column name = `last_name`)
. deploy version `2.0.0` of the application that saves data to `last_name` and `surname` columns.
The app reads from `last_name` column. Db is in version `v2` containing both `last_name` and `surname` columns. The `surname` column is
a copy of the `last_name` column. (NOTE: this column must not have the not null constraint)
. once all apps got deployed in version `2.0.0` run a migration script to copy all data from `last_name` to `surname`
. deploy version `3.0.0` of the application that saves data only to `surname` and reads from `surname`. Db remains in `v2`
. deploy version `4.0.0` of the application - there are no changes in the code. Deploy db in `v3` that first
preforms a final migration of `last_name` to `surname` and removes the `last_name` column. Here you can add any missing constraints

By following this approach you can always rollback one version back without breaking the DB / Application compatibility.

== The issue

Why is this problem worth discussing? Doing A/B testing with Cloud Foundry is extremely simple - it's a matter of executing a single
command. However it's not that trivial in terms of the application and the db.

:module: boot-flyway-v1

=== Initial situation

Version of the app: `1.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v1`

==== Comment

This will be the initial state of the application that we will take into consideration.

==== DB changes

The db contains a column called `last_name`.

== Adding a new column

:module: boot-flyway-v2-newcolumn

=== Adding a new column

Version of the app: `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN`

Version of the DB: `v2newcolumn`

==== Comment

===== Rolling a new version

Steps:

. migrate your db to create the new column called `age`. Now your db is in `v2newcolumn`
. write the code to use the new column. Now your app is in version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN`

If you're using Spring Boot Flyway those two steps will be performed upon booting the version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN` of the app.
If you're running database versioning tool manually then you'd have to do it in separate processes
(first manually upgrade the db version and then deploy the new app).

===== A/B testing

The current situation is that we have an app deployed to production in version `1.0.0` and db in `v1`. We want to deploy the second
instance of the app that will be in version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN` and update the db to `v2newcolumn`.

Steps:

. a new instance is deployed in version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN` that updates the db to `v2newcolumn`
. in the meantime some requests got processed by instances being in version `1.0.0`
. the upgrade is successful and you have some instances working in `1.0.0`, others in `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN`. All are talking to db in `v2newcolumn`
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `age` and version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN` is. They don't interfere each other, no exceptions
should be thrown.

===== Rolling back the application

The current situation is that we have app in version `2.0.0.NEWCOLUMN` and db in `v2newcolumn`.

Steps:

. roll back your app to version `1.0.0`.
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `age` thus rollback should be successful

==== DB changes

The script adds a new column called `age`.

== Renaming a column in backwards-incompatible way

Let's take a look at the following example if you want to change the column name:

WARNING: The following example is deliberately done in such a way that it will break. We're showing it to depict the problem of database
compatibility.

:module: boot-flyway-v2-bad

=== Adding surname

Version of the app: `2.0.0.BAD`

Version of the DB: `v2bad`

==== Comment

Current changes DO NOT allow us to run two instances (old and new) at the same time. Thus zero down time
deployment will be difficult to achieve (if we take into consideration out assumptions it's actually impossible).

===== A/B testing

The current situation is that we have an app deployed to production in version `1.0.0` and db in `v1`. We want to deploy the second
instance of the app that will be in version `2.0.0.BAD` and update the db to `v2bad`.

Steps:

. a new instance is deployed in version `2.0.0.BAD` that updates the db to `v2bad`
. in `v2bad` of the database the column `last_name` is no longer existing - it got changed to `surname`
. the db and app upgrade is successful and you have some instances working in `1.0.0`, others in `2.0.0.BAD`. All are talking to db
in `v2bad`
. all instances of version `1.0.0` will start producing exceptions cause they will try to insert data to `last_name` column which is
no longer there
. all instances of version `2.0.0.BAD` will work without any issues

As you can if we do backwards incompatible changes of the DB and the application, A/B testing is impossible.

===== Rolling back the application

Let's assume that after trying to do A/B deployment we've decided that we need to rollback the app back to version `1.0.0`. We assumed
that we don't want to roll back the database.

Steps:

. we shut down the instance that was running with version `2.0.0.BAD`
. the database is still in `v2bad`
. since version `1.0.0` doesn't understand what `surname` column is it will produce exceptions
. hell broke loose and we can't go back

As you can if we do backwards incompatible changes of the DB and the application, we can't roll back to a previous version.

==== DB changes

The migration script renames the column from `last_name` to `surname`

----

==== Code changes

We have changed the field name from `lastName` to `surName`.

== Renaming a column in backwards-compatible way

TIP: Here we'll present a more sound approach to deployment

This situation is more interesting. Let's assume that we have the DB in version `v1`. As a reminder -
It contains the columns `first_name` and `last_name`. We want to change the `last_name` into `surname`.

We also have the app in version `1.0.0` which doesn't use the `surname` column just yet. Check the `boot-flyway-v1` for an example
of such an application.

:module: boot-flyway-v2

=== Adding surname

Version of the app: `2.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v2`

==== Comment

By adding a new column and copying its contents we have created backwards compatible changes of the db. ATM if we
rollback the JAR / have an old JAR working at the same tame it won't break at runtime.

===== Rolling a new version

Steps:

. migrate your db to create the new column called `surname`. Now your db is in `v2`
. copy the data from the `last_name` column to `surname`. *NOTE* that if you have a lot of this data then you should consider batch
migration!
. write the code to use *BOTH* the *new* and the *old* column. Now your app is in version `2.0.0`

If you're using Spring Boot Flyway those two steps will be performed upon booting the version `2.0.0` of the app.  If you're running
database versioning tool manually then you'd have to do it in separate processes (first manually upgrade the db version and then deploy
the new app).

IMPORTANT: Remember that the newly created column *MUST NOT* be *NOT NULL*. If you rollback, the old app has no knowledge of the new
column and won't set it upon `Insert`. But if you add that constraint and your db is in `v2` it would require the value of the new
column to be set. That would result in constraint violations.

===== A/B testing

The current situation is that we have an app deployed to production in version `1.0.0` and db in `v1`. We want to deploy the second
instance of the app that will be in version `2.0.0` and update the db to `v2`.

Steps:

. a new instance is deployed in version `2.0.0` that updates the db to `v2`
. in the meantime some requests got processed by instances being in version `1.0.0`
. the upgrade is successful and you have some instances working in `1.0.0`, others in `2.0.0`. All are talking to db in `v2`
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `surname` and version `2.0.0` is. They don't interfere each other, no exceptions
should be thrown.
. version `2.0.0` is saving data to both old and new column thus it's backwards compatible

IMPORTANT: If you have any queries that count items basing on values from old / new column you have to remember that now you have
duplicate values (most likely still being migrated). E.g. if you want to count the number of users whose last name (however you call it)
starts with a letter `A` then until the data migration (`old` -> `new` column) is done you might have inconsistent data if you
perform the query against the new column.

===== Rolling back the application

The current situation is that we have app in version `2.0.0` and db in `v2`.

Steps:

. roll back your app to version `1.0.0`.
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `surname` thus rollback should be successful

==== DB changes

The db contains a column called `last_name`.

----

Script adding `surname` column.

WARNING: Remember NOT TO ADD any NOT NULL constraints to the added column. Cause if you rollback the JAR
 the old version doesn't have the notion of the added column and automatically a NULL value will be set. In case
 of having a constraint the old application will blow up.

==== Code changes

We are storing data in both `last_name` and `surname`. Also, we are reading from the `last_name` column cause
it is most up to date (during the deployment process some entries could have been round-robined to the old instance).

=== Removing last name from code

Version of the app: `3.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v2`

==== Comment

By adding a new column and copying its contents we have created backwards compatible changes of the db. ATM if we
rollback the JAR / have an old JAR working at the same time it won't break at runtime.

==== DB changes

There are no structure changes in the DB. The following script is executed that performs the final migration of old data:

:module: boot-flyway-v4

=== Removing last name from db

Version of the app: `4.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v3`

==== Comment

Since code of version `3.0.0` wasn't using `last_name` column, if we roll back to `3.0.0` after removing the
column from the database then nothing bad will happen at runtime.

==== DB changes

In comparison to `v3` we're just removing `last_name` column and add missing constraints.

There are no code changes.

== Projects

We will focus on the most interesting case of changing the column name. That change is backwards
incompatible but we'll try to write it in such a way that A/B testing is possible.

== Spring Boot Sample Flyway

All samples are clones of the `Spring Boot Sample Flyway` project.

You can look at `http://localhost:8080/flyway` to review the list of scripts.

The sample also enables the H2 console (at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`)
so that you can review the state of the database (the default jdbc url is
`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`).
