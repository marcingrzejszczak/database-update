=== Removing last name from db

Version of the app: `4.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v3`

==== Comment

Since code of version `3.0.0` wasn't using `last_name` column, if we roll back to `3.0.0` after removing the
column from the database then nothing bad will happen at runtime.

==== DB changes

In comparison to `v3` we're just removing `last_name` column and add missing constraints.
