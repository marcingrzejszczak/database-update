=== Step 3: Removing last name from code

Version of the app: `3.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v3`

==== Comment

By adding a new column and copying its contents we have created backwards compatible changes of the db. ATM if we
rollback the JAR / have an old JAR working at the same time it won't break at runtime.

==== DB changes

There are no structure changes in the DB. The following script is executed that performs the final migration of old data:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__Final_migration.sql[]
----


==== Code changes

We are storing data in both `last_name` and `surname`. Also, we are reading from the `last_name` column cause
it is most up to date (during the deployment process some entries could have been round-robined to the old instance).
