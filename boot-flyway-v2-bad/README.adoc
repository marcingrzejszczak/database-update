== Adding surname

Version of the app: `2.0.0.BAD`

Version of the DB: `v2`

=== DB changes

The migration script renames the column from `last_name` to `surname`

Initial Flyway script:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql[]
----

Script renaming `last_name`.

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Rename_last_name.sql[]
----

=== Code changes

We have changed the field name from `lastName` to `surName`.

=== Comment

Current changes DO NOT allow us to run two instances (old and new) at the same time. Thus zero down time
deployment will be difficult to achieve (if we take into consideration out assumptions it's actually impossible).
